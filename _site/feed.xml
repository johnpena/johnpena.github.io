        <title>Surrounded by reality</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;From the comments of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.socketsite.com/archives/2015/09/planning-approves-waterfront-high-rise-sets-stage-for-an-epic-battle.html&quot;&gt;this article about San Francisco waterfront building controversies&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I think it was Winston Churchill (or perhaps Jesus) who said, “A young man who is pro-development has no heart, and an old man who is against development has no brain.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was Jesus. Said this after the Jerusalem Planning Commission rejected his application for a 200 foot residential tower (which he believed would showcase his carpentry skills) right next to the Dome of the Rock. Some people think this is what drove him to his Plan B â becoming the Messiah and starting a new religion. Jerusalem never did get that condo tower, and rents there have been too high ever since.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>A couple links</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A couple great reads I’ve come across recently:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://all-things-andy-gavin.com/2011/02/02/making-crash-bandicoot-part-1/&quot;&gt;Making Crash Bandicoot&lt;/a&gt;
series by Andy Gavin, co-founder of Naughty Dog.  I love reading developers’
journals about their projects, especially big ones like this that take you
through the scary early days and all the little decisions that added up into
something great. This one is a pretty long read (a 10 part story, each part
takes 5-10 minutes to read) but touches on some really interesting stuff –
the original ideas for a 3D platform game, how they negotiated with
Sony/Universal Studios, the in-house lisp dialect they made for the game,
plus lots of other gritty technical details. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.jeremyrwelch.com/tesla-is-a-battery-company&quot;&gt;Tesla is a Battery Company&lt;/a&gt; 
by my friend Jeremy Welch. Not only a great perspective on Tesla’s long term
game plan, but a glimpse into the United States’ “distributed energy future”.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mobile.nytimes.com/2015/05/12/upshot/more-consensus-on-coffees-benefits-than-you-might-think.html?_r=1&quot;&gt;More Consensus on Coffee’s Benefits Than You Might Think&lt;/a&gt;
on the New York Times’ TheUpshot blog. I don’t need an excuse to drink more
coffee, but here it is anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/thelist/what-s-one-thing-you-ve-learned-at-harvard-business-school-that-blew-your-mind-fdea346a0422&quot;&gt;“What’s one thing you’ve learned at Harvard Business School that blew your mind?”&lt;/a&gt;
by Ellen Chisa on Medium. Ellen goes through each of the classes she took
while getting an MBA at Harvard Business School. Lessons learned +
recommended case studies. Reading this made me want to get an MBA.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology&quot;&gt;Choose Boring Technology&lt;/a&gt;
by Dan McKinley, an engineer at Stripe, on why you should choose trusted (ie boring)
technologies when building a business. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
