                <h3> 2015 </h3>
                <p> 
                    At the beginning of 2014 I did what most people do -- I set up
                    some new years resolutions and some goals to go along with
                    them. About a month later I had forgotten about them or gave up
                    on most of them entirely.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I made this page in an effort to make 2015 different from 2014. 
                    Here's a list of all my goals and my progress on all of them. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    If you're interested,
                    <a href="https://github.com/johnpena/johnpena.github.io/blob/master/static/2015.js">here</a> 
                    is the code that I'm using to generate the lists and charts in this page, and
                    <a href="https://github.com/johnpena/johnpena.github.io/blob/master/Rakefile">here</a>
                    is the script I'm using to scrape all of my data.

                <h3> This year's goals </h3>

                <h4> 1. Run 400 miles </h4>
                <p> 
                    Starting off my first goal by setting the bar low. This
                    comes out to a 2.5 mile run 3 times a week. This is not overwhelming
                    and I can still probably finish it even if I get off to a bad start.
                </p>

                <h4> 2. Go to the gym 150 times </h4>
                <p> 
                    I like the 3 times a week rule. This, along with the running,
                    gives me something active to do almost every day of the week with one
                    day of rest. 
                </p>

                <h4> 3. Go to yoga 50 times </h4>
                <p> 
                    This one is a really low bar and I'm hoping to clear it
                    with room to spare. This is only once a week and leaves two
                    weeks for vacation or just being busy.
                </p>

                <h4> 4. Read 25 books </h4>
                <p> 
                    This comes out to about 2 a month. In 2014 I read more than
                    this, but I was definitely rushing to hit my goal. This year
                    I'm setting a lower bar so that I actually enjoy what I'm reading.
