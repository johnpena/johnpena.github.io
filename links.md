In no particular order, here are some of my favorite things on the internet:

* [The Tom Hanks Rocket](http://tomhanksrocket.ytmnd.com/) -- YTMND has a ton of gold if you're willing to pan for it. This is my favorite one.
* [Programming Sucks](http://www.stilldrinking.org/programming-sucks) -- The best description of programming that I've ever read.
* [The Internet with a Human Face](http://idlewords.com/talks/internet_with_a_human_face.htm) -- this talk/article does a great job describing some of the social problems that have started to manifest in the 20-teen decade, and how we might fix them. 
* [Primus performs Those Damned Blue-Collar Tweakers at Woodstock '94](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiQa8pIVPjI) -- Primus sucks! But seriously, look at the way the crowd goes nuts when they open the song. 
* [The source code for DOOM](https://github.com/id-Software/DOOM) -- I can't believe this doesn't have more github stars. This game is what got me programming. 
* [Uncanny Valley](https://nplusonemag.com/issue-25/on-the-fringe/uncanny-valley/) -- Basically a contemporary version of Office Space in written form. 
* [Rockwell Retro Encabulator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXJKdh1KZ0w) -- What I imagine I sound like when I talk about programming
