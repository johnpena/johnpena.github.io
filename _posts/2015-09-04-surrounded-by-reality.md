From the comments of [this article about San Francisco waterfront building controversies](http://www.socketsite.com/archives/2015/09/planning-approves-waterfront-high-rise-sets-stage-for-an-epic-battle.html):


>I think it was Winston Churchill (or perhaps Jesus) who said, "A young man who is pro-development has no heart, and an old man who is against development has no brain."

>>It was Jesus. Said this after the Jerusalem Planning Commission rejected his application for a 200 foot residential tower (which he believed would showcase his carpentry skills) right next to the Dome of the Rock. Some people think this is what drove him to his Plan B â becoming the Messiah and starting a new religion. Jerusalem never did get that condo tower, and rents there have been too high ever since.
